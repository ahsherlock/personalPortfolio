# personalPortfolio
My own personal portfolio website. It's a full stack site made using Python and Django. 
This is going to be a website where I display some of my favorite projects, resume, github, and LinkedIn accounts. Also, this website 
will function as a personal blog in which I document my journey through tech starting as a recent college graduate. 
Check it out frequently for updates!
